MOON

The purpose of MOON is to create a concrete MODEL of the data being manipulated 
that can then have views to display it, such as with the skin / template system 
and controllers to manipulate it as per some user API such as the action system.

MOON does this by providing a hiarachical object interface collection where 
objects directly express the implied relationship between CMS parts. For example
a blog acts as a factory to provide the items it collects and items their 
comments. While it would not be very practical to do so it would be possible to 
address a comment from a blog like this:

First comment on most recent item:

    echo $oBlogObj->item(0)->comment(0)->link; // Output: http://example.com 

This is not perfect for example oCat and oBlog should probably share a common
parent class rather than cat being a child of blog. This might change.
